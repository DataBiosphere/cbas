# Composite Batch Analysis Service (C-BAS)

## Contributing

For compliance reasons, all pull requests **must** be submitted with a Jira ID in the pull request title.
You should include the Jira ID near the beginning of the title for better readability.
For example: "[WM-1992] add statement to README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md about including Jira IDs in PR titles" 

If there is more than one relevant ticket, include all of their Jira IDs.
For example: "WM-1997, WM-2002, WM-2005: Fix for many bugs with the same root cause"
